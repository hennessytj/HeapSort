# heapSort

This project implements two sorting algorithms and compares their performance.  The algorithms are used to compare order of growth of running time 
for quadratic and linearithmic sorting algorithms.  Insertionsort and heapsort are the respective algorithms.  Additionally, each algorithm's 
performance is measured sorting primitive types versus sorting reference types.  No specific conclusions are drawn from this analysis,
just very general ones.
