# heapSort

This project implements two sorting algorithms and compares their performance.  The algorithms are used to compare order of growth of running time 
for quadratic and linearithmic sorting algorithms.  Insertionsort and heapsort are the respective algorithms.  Additionally, each algorithm's 
performance is measured sorting primitive types versus sorting reference types.  

Includes:
Heapsort -primitive version
Heapsort -generic version (sort anything implementing comparable)

Insertionsort -primitive version
Insertionsort -generic version (sort anything implementing comparable)
